	Configuration Notes
--------------------------------------------------------

PixelTrip offers a variety of settings to help tweak to your liking and environment. 
Below is a brief description of each setting.

Use Full Screen Flipping Chain --
through DirectDraw a series of BackBuffers are allocated in video memory and are 'flipped' with
each frame rendered to the screen. When turned off then a single backbuffer is allocated and copy to the 
screen via a fast Hardware Blt. 

Start Full Screen --
On start of the PixelTrip PlugIn if this checkbox is set then PixelTrip will go into full screen mode.
Otherwise a desktop window, that you can resize, will be created that can also be maximized to enter full screen mode.

Full Screen Video Modes --
Select from the list a Full Screen Video mode that suits your PC. If the number of Frames Per Second being generated falls
below 20 than it is recommended you select a Full Screen Video mode at a lower resolution.

Extend CPU Utilization --
When set, PixelTrip will use as many CPU cycles as possible. When not set, PixelTrip will utilize less than 76% of the CPU.

Show Frames Per Second --
When set, the number of frames rendered per second will be displayed in the upper left corner of the window or full screen
HotKey 'F' or 'f' can be used during play to toggle display of Frames Per Second

Use Beat Detection --
When set, beat detection will be enabled.
HotKey 'D' or 'd' can be used during play to toggle state of Beat Detection

Enable PixelTrip Motion --
In addition to applying general polar coordinate transforms to the WMP waveform data, PixelTrip will also move the 
rendered scene to provide the appearance of motion. Three options can be set:
	Never - never use this option
	Sometimes - randomly select when this option is on and off
	Always - always use this option

Enable Motion Bounce --
Basic Beat Detection provides a visual in the form of color, shape change etc. This option will add a bounce to any 
motion rendered in the scene. This can provide for some wild scenes ... but is not for everyone (particularly if you are susceptible to motion sickness)
Three options can be set:
	Never - never use this option
	Sometimes - randomly select when this option is on and off
	Always - always use this option

Beat Sensitivity -- 
The beat detection algorithm used was designed to allow for a sensitivity setting. If PixelTrip is failing to 
detect a beat in your taste of music or is incorrectly finding a beat ... try lowering or raising this value.
The default setting is 62

Desired FPS --
For smaller displays the number of frames per second rendered can run over 100. This can be very unpleasing and so this
option can be used to force a constant number of frames per second irregardless of window size. 
All internal PixelTrip settings were selected with an FPS value of 24 thru 30 in mind. It is recommended you stay within this range.
*A value of -1 indicates the maximum number of frames per second achievable should be used.

Additional HotKeys --
HotKey T: Toggles application of a Transform Vector Field On and Off
HotKey U: Clears the screen
